
Hey Scott- whenever I code I make a file for notes that I delete at the end. I though it could be an easy way for us to 
also communicate while working back and forth on the file. 

********project notes*********** 


4/15 items still needed for Milestone:  

5 points for submitting your classes and methods. These need to well documented (Javadoc comments)
5 points for the design being good
3 points for completing the code of a non-trivial method (User input or reading CSV) 
2 points for the unit test
